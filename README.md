## 🌐 About the Initiative
The **Move Together Challenge** is a school-wide physical activity program that encourages students to complete small, achievable daily movement goals.  
The initiative is built on inclusivity, accessibility, and student leadership.

## 🎯 Project Goals
This project addresses the 6 core criteria required for the assessment:

### 1. Identify a Community Need or Gap
Many students have limited opportunities for enjoyable, low-pressure daily movement.  
This initiative fills that gap by offering easy, inclusive physical activities anyone can join.

### 2. Promote Respectful & Inclusive Relationships
Activities are supportive and non-competitive.  
Students work in pairs or small groups to build positive, respectful connections.

### 3. Encourage Physical Activity
The challenge includes:
- Daily 10–15 minute movement goals  
- Walking groups  
- Stretching & yoga  
- Low-impact & chair-friendly options  

### 4. Address Health Inequities
This initiative removes barriers like cost, equipment needs, or ability level.  
Everyone can participate safely.

### 5. Explore Mental Health Perceptions
The challenge promotes the message that **movement improves mental health** and reduces stress.  
It helps reduce the stigma around physical activity being “only for sporty people.”

### 6. Show Youth Influence
Students help lead and organise activities, proving young people can influence school wellbeing in positive ways.
