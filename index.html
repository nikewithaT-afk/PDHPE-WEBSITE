    <h2>1. Identifying a Community Need or Gap</h2>
    <p>Many students spend most of the school day sitting, with limited opportunities for enjoyable daily physical activity. 
    PE lessons alone are not enough, and not all students join sports teams. Our school needs a program that is fun, flexible,
    and accessible to all students—regardless of ability or background.</p>
    <p>The Move Together Challenge fills this gap by offering low-pressure, inclusive daily movement opportunities that help students stay healthy and connected.</p>
</section>

<section id="inclusive" class="card">
    <h2>2. Promoting Respectful & Inclusive Relationships</h2>
    <p>The challenge encourages students to participate in pairs or small groups, building supportive and respectful connections.
    Activities are non-competitive, allowing students to move at their own pace without judgement. The initiative supports cultural safety
    by offering a wide variety of movement options and celebrating diversity.</p>
</section>

<section id="activity" class="card">
    <h2>3. Encouraging Physical Activity</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10–15 minute daily movement goals</li>
        <li>Walking groups & stretching sessions</li>
        <li>Dance, yoga, sports mini-games</li>
        <li>Low-impact and chair-friendly options</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All activities are simple, safe, and designed to include different fitness levels and interests.</p>
</section>

<section id="equity" class="card">
    <h2>4. Addressing Health Inequities</h2>
    <p>The program removes common barriers such as cost, confidence, and accessibility. It requires no equipment, 
    uses simple visuals for different languages, and provides multiple ability-friendly options. This ensures all students,
    regardless of background or circumstances, can participate safely.</p>
</section>

<section id="mental" class="card">
    <h2>5. Exploring Mental Health Perceptions</h2>
    <p>Many young people believe physical activity is only for athletes. Move Together challenges this by promoting the message 
    that movement helps reduce stress, boosts mood, improves sleep, and supports mental health. The program aims to reduce stigma 
    and make physical wellbeing feel achievable for all students.</p>
</section>

<section id="impact" class="card">
    <h2>6. Showing Youth Influence</h2>
    <p>Students lead the promotion and organisation of the challenge, proving that young people have a powerful voice in supporting 
    health and wellbeing. By designing and running this initiative, students demonstrate leadership, creativity, and positive influence 
    within the school community.</p>
